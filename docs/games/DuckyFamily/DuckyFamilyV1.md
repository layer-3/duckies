## DuckyFamilyV1

DuckyFamily contract defines rules of Ducky Family game, which is a card game similar to Happy Families and Uno games.
This game also incorporates vouchers as defined in IVoucher interface.

DuckyFamily operates on Ducklings NFT, which is defined in a corresponding contract. DuckyFamily can mint, burn and query information about NFTs
by calling Ducklings contract.

Users can buy NFT (card) packs of different size. When a pack is bought, a number of cards is generated and assigned to the user.
The packs can be bought with Duckies token, so user should approve DuckyFamily contract to spend Duckies on his behalf.

Each card has a unique genome, which is a 256-bit number. The genome is a combination of different genes, which describe the card and its properties.
There are 3 types of cards introduced in this game, which are differentiated by the 'collection' gene: Duckling, Zombeak and Mythic.
Duckling and Zombeak NFTs have a class system, which is defined by 'rarity' gene: Common, Rare, Epic and Legendary.
Mythic NFTs are not part of the class system and are considered to be the most rare and powerful cards in the game.

All cards have a set of generative genes, which are used to describe the card, its rarity and image.
There are 2 types of generative genes: with even and uneven chance for each value of that gene.
All values of even genes are generated with equal probability, while uneven genes have a higher chance for the first values and lower for the last values.
Thus, while even genes can describe the card, uneven can set the rarity of the card.

Note: don't confuse 'rarity' gene with rarity of the card. 'Rarity' gene is a part of the game logic, while rarity of the card is a value this card represents.
Henceforth, if a 'Common' rarity gene card has uneven generative genes with high values (which means this card has a tiny chance to being generated),
then this card can be more rare than some 'Rare' rarity gene cards.
So, when we mean 'rarity' gene, we will use quotes, while when we mean rarity of the card, we will use it without quotes.

Duckling are the main cards in the game, as they are the only way users can get Mythic cards.
However, users are not obliged to use every Duckling cards to help them get Mythic, they can improve them and collect the rarest ones.
Users can get Duckling cards from minting packs.

Users can improve the 'rarity' of the card by melding them. Melding is a process of combining a flock of 5 cards to create a new one.
The new card will have the same 'collection' gene as the first card in the flock, but the 'rarity' gene will be incremented.
However, users must oblige to specific rules when melding cards:
1. All cards in the flock must have the same 'collection' gene.
2. All cards in the flock must have the same 'rarity' gene.
3a. When melding Common cards, all cards in the flock must have either the same Color or Family gene values.
3b. When melding Rare and Epic cards, all cards in the flock must have both the same Color and Family gene values.
3c. When melding Legendary cards, all cards in the flock must have the same Color and different Family gene values.
4. Mythic cards cannot be melded.
5. Legendary Zombeak cards cannot be melded.

Other generative genes of the melded card are not random, but are calculated from the genes of the source cards.
This process is called 'inheritance' and is the following:
1. Each generative gene is inherited separately
2. A gene has a high chance of being inherited from the first card in the flock, and this chance is lower for each next card in the flock.
3. A gene has a mere chance of 'positive mutation', which sets inherited gene value to be bigger than the biggest value of this gene in the flock.

Melding is not free and has a different cost for each 'rarity' of the cards being melded.

Zombeak are secondary cards, that you can only get when melding mutates. There is a different chance (defined in Config section below) for each 'rarity' of the Duckling cards that are being melded,
that the melding result card will mutate to Zombeak. If the melding mutates, then the new card will have the same 'rarity' gene as the source cards.
This logic makes Zombeak cards more rare than some Duckling cards, as they can only be obtained by melding mutating.
However, Zombeak cards cannot be melded into Mythic, which means their main value is rarity.

Mythic are the most rare and powerful cards in the game. They can only be obtained by melding Legendary Duckling cards with special rules described above.
The rarity of the Mythic card is defined by the 'UniqId' gene, which corresponds to the picture of the card. The higher the 'UniqId' gene value, the rarer the card.
The 'UniqId' value is correlated with the 'peculiarity' of the flock that creates the Mythic: the higher the peculiarity, the higher the 'UniqId' value.
Peculiarity of the card is a sum of all uneven gene values of this card, and peculiarity of the flock is a sum of peculiarities of all cards in the flock.

Mythic cards give bonuses to their owned depending on their rarity. These bonuses will be revealed in the future, but they may include
free Yellow tokens (with vesting claim mechanism), an ability to change existing cards, stealing / fighting other cards, etc.
