## IBlacklist

This feature is blocking transfers of reported stolen funds from exchanges or engaged in malicious activities.

To safeguard user funds against any potential manipulation, specific roles are assigned to different accounts.
One account is authorized to blacklist other accounts while another account is authorized to burn funds.
By dividing these responsibilities between two different accounts, the risk of misuse of this functionality is reduced.
